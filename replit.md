# User Management & Authentication Platform

## Overview

This repository is designed to implement a comprehensive User Management and Authentication system that serves as the backbone for modern digital platforms. The system provides a secure and reliable framework for account management, login processes, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control (RBAC). The architecture follows industry best practices for security, scalability, and user experience.

## System Architecture

The system follows a microservices architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend components:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: React with Tailwind CSS or Flutter Web/Mobile
- **Design Pattern**: Atomic Design with Design Tokens
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
- **Theme Support**: Dark/Light mode toggle
- **Accessibility**: ARIA compliance and keyboard navigation support
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support via locale files

### Backend Architecture
- **Microservices Pattern**: Containerized services using Docker and Kubernetes
- **Technology Options**: Node.js (Express/Koa), Python (FastAPI), or Java (Spring Boot)
- **Service-Oriented**: Each authentication feature is implemented as a separate service
- **Stateless Design**: JWT-based authentication with refresh token mechanism

## Key Components

### Authentication Services
1. **Auth Service**: Handles JWT/OAuth token issuance, verification, and renewal
2. **User Service**: Manages user account CRUD operations and profile management
3. **Two-Factor Authentication Service**: Generates and verifies TOTP, handles WebAuthn challenges
4. **Passwordless Service**: Manages passwordless authentication via email/SMS links
5. **Session Service**: Stores sessions in Redis, handles renewal and invalidation

### Frontend Components
1. **Login/Registration Pages**: Multiple authentication methods (password, OAuth, passwordless)
2. **2FA Modal/Pages**: Support for TOTP, SMS, and WebAuthn
3. **Password Reset Flow**: Step-by-step process with progress indication
4. **Profile Management**: User settings and security preferences
5. **Session Management Dashboard**: Active device/session overview
6. **Admin Role Management Panel**: RBAC configuration interface

### Authentication Methods
- Email/password authentication
- OAuth 2.0 integration (Google, Apple ID)
- Passwordless authentication
- Multi-factor authentication (TOTP, SMS, WebAuthn)
- Risk-based authentication

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration**: Email verification → Profile creation → Optional 2FA setup
2. **Login Process**: Credential validation → 2FA challenge (if enabled) → JWT issuance
3. **Token Management**: Short-lived JWT access tokens with long-lived refresh tokens
4. **Session Handling**: Redis-based session storage with automatic cleanup
5. **Password Reset**: Secure token generation → Email/SMS delivery → Verification → Reset

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party Services
- **OAuth Providers**: Google, Apple ID for social authentication
- **SMS Service**: For SMS-based 2FA and passwordless authentication
- **Email Service**: For email verification and password reset
- **WebAuthn**: For biometric authentication support

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- **Redis**: Session storage and caching
- **Database**: User data persistence (compatible with various databases)
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker and Kubernetes for deployment
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and security vulnerability scanning

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Local development with Docker containers
- Hot reloading for rapid development
- Automated testing suite integration

### Production Deployment
- Kubernetes-based orchestration
- Gradual rollout strategy
- Health checks and monitoring
- Automated security scanning
- Load balancing and auto-scaling

### Security Measures
- Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/TLS)
- Secure token storage
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Regular security audits
- Compliance with authentication standards

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
